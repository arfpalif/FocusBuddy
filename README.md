# FocusBuddy

FocusBuddy is an Android application designed to help users manage their focus and reduce distractions from social media. By tracking and limiting the usage of social media apps, FocusBuddy empowers users to stay productive and mindful of their screen time.

## Features

✅ **Usage Tracking** – Monitor the duration of time spent on selected social media apps  
✅ **Time Limiting** – Set daily limits for each social media app; receive alerts or restrictions when the limit is exceeded  
✅ **App Blocking** – Automatically block access to apps after exceeding the set time limit  
✅ **Dashboard** – View detailed reports of app usage over time  
✅ **Customizable Settings** – Adjust time limits and select which apps to track or block  

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Kotlin
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** Android Jetpack, ViewModel, LiveData
- **Database:** Room (or specify if you use another)

## How It Works

1. User selects which apps to track and sets daily time limits.
2. FocusBuddy runs in the background to monitor app usage.
3. If the user exceeds the time limit, FocusBuddy blocks the app or sends a notification to discourage further use.
4. Users can view their usage stats on the dashboard.
